# 1288 Remove Covered Intervals

Given a list of intervals, remove all intervals that are covered by another interval in the list.

Interval [a,b) is covered by interval [c,d) if and only if c <= a and b <= d.

After doing so, return the number of remaining intervals. 

Example 1:

> Input: intervals = [[1,4],[3,6],[2,8]]
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: Interval [3,6] is covered by [2,8], therefore it is removed.

Example 2:

> Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,3]]
> 
> Output: 1

Example 3:

> Input: intervals = [[0,10],[5,12]]
> 
> Output: 2

Example 4:

> Input: intervals = [[3,10],[4,10],[5,11]]
> 
> Output: 2

Example 5:

> Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,4],[3,4]]
> 
> Output: 1 

Constraints:

> 1 <= intervals.length <= 1000
> 
> intervals[i].length == 2
> 
> 0 <= intervals[i][0] < intervals[i][1] <= 10^5
> 
> All the intervals are unique.

## Solution

### C++
                                    
```C++
// this solution will count the number of overlapped interval then get the result by deducting the count.                                        
class Solution {
public:
    static bool comp(vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b){
        if (a[0] != b[0]){
            return a[0] < b[0];
        }else{
            return a[1] > b[1];
        }
    }
    
    int removeCoveredIntervals(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        // - Sort the intervals in increasing order of starting point
        // - If starting points are same, in decreasing order of ending point
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), comp);
        
        int _max = INT_MIN;
        int count = 0;
        
        // - Compare the ending points in the sorted intervals
		
        // - If at any index the ending point is less than the current maximum ending point
        //   that interval is the included one 
		//   (remember the starting point of the current is already greater than that
		//   of all the previous intervals, so now when the ending point is lesser than the current max ending point
		//   it means that interval is included in atleast one of the previous intervals)
		
        // - Count the included ones and return size()-count
		
		// Note: If the starting index are equal, we sorted according to decreasing ending index so that it can be
		// counted too as an included one
		
        for (int i = 0; i<intervals.size(); i++){
            if (intervals[i][1] <= _max){
                count ++;
            }else{
                _max = intervals[i][1];
            }
        }
        return intervals.size()-count;
    }
};                                       
```

### Java

* This solution will directly get the number of uncovered intervals
```Java
class Solution {
    public int removeCoveredIntervals(int[][] A) {
        int res = 0, left = -1, right = -1;
        // sort by ascending of left border
        Arrays.sort(A, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        for (int[] v : A) {       
            // there will be no case when current v[0] < previous v[0] since sorted with v[0]
            // but still need to use a left variable to check whether current v[0] == previous v[0] && current v[1] >= previous v[1]
            // and a right variable to check whether current v[0] > previous v[0] but current v[1] <= previous v[1]
            // it is a covered intervals if v[0] == left && v[1] >= right
            // it is a covered intervals if v[0] > left && v[1] <= right
            if (v[0] > left && v[1] > right) {
                // update the left boundary to last interval
                left = v[0];                
                // it is a uncovered intervals i.e. [1,4] -> [2,5]
                ++res;
            }
            // update the right boundary to last interval
            right = Math.max(right, v[1]);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
