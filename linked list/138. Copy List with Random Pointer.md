# 138. Copy List with Random Pointer

A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or null.

Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.

For example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where X.random --> Y, then for the corresponding two nodes x and y in the copied list, x.random --> y.

Return the head of the copied linked list.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:

> val: an integer representing Node.val
> 
> random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) that the random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.

Your code will only be given the head of the original linked list.

Example 1:

![Figure 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/18/e1.png)

> Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
> 
> Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]

Example 2:

![Figure 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/18/e2.png)

> Input: head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
> 
> Output: [[1,1],[2,1]]

Example 3:

![Figure 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/18/e3.png)

> Input: head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
> 
> Output: [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]

Example 4:

> Input: head = []
> 
> Output: []
> 
> Explanation: The given linked list is empty (null pointer), so return null. 

Constraints:

> 0 <= n <= 1000
> 
> -10000 <= Node.val <= 10000
> 
> Node.random is null or is pointing to some node in the linked list.

## Solution

### C++
```cpp
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    Node* next;
    Node* random;
    
    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        next = NULL;
        random = NULL;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    Node* copyRandomList(Node* head) {
        if(head == NULL){
            return head;
        }
        
        Node* oldHead;
        Node* newHead;
        
        // will stop at oldHead == NULL
        for(oldHead = head; oldHead != NULL; oldHead = oldHead->next->next){
            // initialize a Node object in heap
            newHead = new Node(oldHead->val);
            // newHead pointer's next pointer point to next node of current oldHead pointer
            newHead->next = oldHead->next;
            // oldHead pointer's next pointer point to newHead
            oldHead->next = newHead;
        }
        
        for(oldHead = head; oldHead != NULL; oldHead = oldHead->next->next){
            // if random pointer point to somewhere, then point newHead (oldHead->next)'s random pointer to the element point by (oldHead->random->next) oldHead's random pointer. 
            if(oldHead->random != NULL){
                oldHead->next->random = oldHead->random->next;
            }
        }
        
        // need an extra Node pointer because newHead will point to the last element and oldHead will lose track of all new Node at the end of loop.
        Node* list2 = head->next;
        for(oldHead = head; oldHead != NULL; oldHead = oldHead->next){
            // get newHead
            newHead = oldHead->next;
            // splice newHead out and point oldHead's next pointer to the original element points by oldHead->next;
            oldHead->next = oldHead->next->next;
            // if there is still next node of original Node
            if(newHead->next != NULL){
                newHead->next = newHead->next->next;
            }
        }
        
        return list2;
    }
};
```
