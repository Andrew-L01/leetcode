# 142. Linked List Cycle II

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Notice that you should not modify the linked list.

Example 1:

 ![Figure 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)

> Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
> 
> Output: tail connects to node index 1
> 
> Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

Example 2:

![Figure 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)

> Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
> 
> Output: tail connects to node index 0
> 
> Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

Example 3:

![Figure 3](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)

> Input: head = [1], pos = -1
> 
> Output: no cycle
> 
> Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

Constraints:

> The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
> 
> -105 <= Node.val <= 105
> 
> pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.

### C++
```cpp

/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
        
// at the point when slow and fast pointers meet, fast pointer will travel at least 1 or N full loop (y + z)
// so 2(x + y) == x + y + N(y + z)
// if we start a slow pointer at meeting point, it will always land in the same point after 1 or N full loop (y + z)
// by definition, x is the path before entry of the loop, y is the distance from the entry of the loop to the meeting point
// so if the slow pointer starts at meeting point, travelled 1 or N full loop minus y, N(y + z) - y
// the slow pointer will stop at the entry point, x
// how to prove that the slow pointer starts at head will meet with the slow pointer starts at meeting point ?
// we can see that x + y == N(y + z), so both slow pointers will travel y distance at same speed
// x + y == N(y + z) indicates that both slow pointers will meet at meeting point, provided one starts at head, another at meeting point
// if each slow pointer travels less y distance, then they will meet at entry point since it will the same amount of time to travel y distance.

    ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head;

            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
            
            // if meet at x + y
            if(slow == fast) {
                ListNode* index1 = head;
                ListNode* index2 = fast;
                
                // keep moving till both pointers meet each other. 
                while(index1 != index2) {
                    index1 = index1->next;
                    index2 = index2->next;
                }
                
                return index1;

        return NULL;
