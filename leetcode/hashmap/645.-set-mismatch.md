# 645. Set Mismatch

You have a set of integers `s`, which originally contains all the numbers from `1` to `n`. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in `s` got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in **repetition of one** number and **loss of another** number.

You are given an integer array `nums` representing the data status of this set after the error.

Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return them in the form of an array.

Example 1:

> Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
> 
> Output: [2,3]

Example 2:

> Input: nums = [1,1]
> 
> Output: [1,2]

Constraints:

* 2 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>

## Solution

### C++

1. Count the expected sum using the formula: (n * (n + 1)) / 2.
2. Decrement the expected sum with each encountered number and find the repeating number using an unordered_set.
3. What's left in the expected sum variable depends on the repeating number, so we could find out the missing number by taking account of the difference between expected and actual sum.
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findErrorNums(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_set<int> set;
        int duplicate = 0;
        int sum = nums.size() * (nums.size() + 1) / 2;
        
        for(int i: nums){
            if(set.find(i) != set.end()){
                duplicate = i;        
            }
            sum -= i;
            set.insert(i);
        }
        
        return {duplicate, duplicate + sum};
    }
};
```
