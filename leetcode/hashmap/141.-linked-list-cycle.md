# 141. Linked List Cycle

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that** `pos` **is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` *if there is a cycle in the linked list*. Otherwise, return `false`.

Example 1:

> Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
> 
> Output: true
> 
> Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)

> Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
> 
> Output: true
> 
> Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

Example 3:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)

> Input: head = [1], pos = -1
> 
> Output: false
> 
> Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

Constraints:

* The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10<sup>4</sup>].
* -10<sup>5</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

## Solution

### C++

    /**
     * Definition for singly-linked list.
     * struct ListNode {
     *     int val;
     *     ListNode *next;
     *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
     * };
     */

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        // must use ListNode* because there may be different nodes with same value. 
        unordered_set<ListNode*> set;
        ListNode* curr = head;
        
        while(curr){
            if(set.find(curr) != set.end()){
                return true;
            }
            set.insert(curr);
            curr = curr->next;
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};
```
