# 451. Sort Characters By Frequency

Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters, and return the sorted string. 

Example 1:

> Input: s = "tree"
> 
> Output: "eert"
> 
> Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
> 
> So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:

> Input: s = "cccaaa"
> 
> Output: "aaaccc"
> 
> Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
> 
> Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.

Example 3:

> Input: s = "Aabb"
> 
> Output: "bbAa"
> 
> Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
> 
> Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.

Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 105
* s consists of English letters and digits.

## Solution

### C++

```C++
class Solution {
public:    
    string frequencySort(string s) {
        unordered_map<char, int> freq;
        
        // count the occurences of character
        for(char c: s){
            freq[c]++;
        }
        
        // sort descendingly based on the freq map. 
        sort(s.begin(), s.end(), [&](char a, char b){
            if(freq[a] == freq[b]){
                // this is very important, so two different characters with the same occurences will be separated into two clusters. 
                return a < b;
            }
            else {
                return freq[a] > freq[b];
            }
        });
        
        return s;
    }
};
```
