# 594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence

We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is **exactly 1**.

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.

A **subsequence** of array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. 

Example 1:

> Input: nums = [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].

Example 2:

> Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
> 
> Output: 2

Example 3:

> Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
> 
> Output: 0

Constraints:

* 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
* -109 <= nums[i] <= 109

## Solution 

### C++

1. The subsequence could be formed by deleting some element, which means does not need to be continuous initially.
2. So we count the number of occurrences of each distinct character and store into an unordered_map. 
3. Then, count the length of the subsequences formed with the pair of number (a,b), which |a - b| == 1, i.e., (3,4) or (7,8)
4. For each pair (a,b), we only need to find the complement of each number, either exist a + 1 for a or b - 1 for b.
5. Checking for both conditions work but it is unnecessary.
```C++
class Solution {
public:
      int findLHS(vector<int>& nums) {
          unordered_map<int, int> map;
          int longestLen = 0;
          
          for(int i: nums) {
              map[i]++;
          }
          
          for(pair<int, int> p: map){
              if(map.find(p.first - 1) != map.end()){
                  longestLen = max(longestLen, p.second + map[p.first - 1]);                   
              }
          }
          
          return longestLen;
      }
};
```

* One-pass
1. One-pass, so need to check for both conditions.
2. Otherwise, if there is **NO** check for map.find(i + 1) then the pair *(i, i + 1)* will be missed provided there is *i* number appear after *(i + 1)* number. 
3. Similarly, if **NO** check for map.find(i - 1) then the pair *(i, i + 1)* will be missed provided there is *(i + 1)* number appear after *i* number.
```C++
class Solution {
public:
      int findLHS(vector<int>& nums) {
          unordered_map<int, int> map;
          int longestLen = 0;
          
          for(int i: nums){
              map[i]++;
              if(map.find(i - 1) != map.end()){
                  longestLen = max(longestLen, map[i - 1] + map[i]);
              }
              if(map.find(i + 1) != map.end()){
                  longestLen = max(longestLen, map[i + 1] + map[i]);
              }
          }
          
          return longestLen;
      }
};
```
