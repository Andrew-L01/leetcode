Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order. 

Example 1:

> Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
> 
> Output: [0,6]
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
> 
> The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".

Example 2:

> Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
> 
> Output: [0,1,2]
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
> 
> The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
> 
> The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".

Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 104
* s and p consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

### C++

Use a hashmap as fixed window.
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findAnagrams(string s, string p) {
        vector<int> sMap(26, 0), pMap(26, 0), ret;
        
        if(p.size() > s.size()){
            return ret;
        }
        
        // check whether the first n == p.size() characters of s is anagram of p.
        for(int i = 0; i < p.size(); i++){
            pMap[p[i] - 'a']++;
            sMap[s[i] - 'a']++;
        }
        
        // store index 0 if it is. 
        if(pMap == sMap){
            ret.push_back(0);
        }
        
        // for each right boundary move to the right, there is a left boundary move to the right, so it is a fixed window. 
        for(int i = p.size(); i < s.size(); i++){
            // store current element. 
            sMap[s[i] - 'a']++;
            // move the left boundary by one step to the right so need to remove the element out of boundary
            sMap[s[i - p.size()] - 'a']--;
            
            // if current window contains enough character to form anagram of p string. 
            if(pMap == sMap){
                ret.push_back(i - p.size() + 1);
            }
        }    
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
