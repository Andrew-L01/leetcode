# Isomorphic Strings

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:

> Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
> 
> Output: true

Example 2:

> Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
> 
> Output: false

Example 3:

> Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
> 
> Output: true 

Constraints:

  > 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
  > 
  > t.length == s.length
  > 
  > s and t consist of any valid ascii character.

## Solution

### C++

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isIsomorphic(string s, string t) {
        // need to use 256 because there is not only lowercase alphabet
        int arrS[256] = {0};
        int arrT[256] = {0};
        int count = 1;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++){
            // if each character exists before, but they are not the same pair, then return false.
            // all characters are map to 0 at the start.
            if(arrS[s[i]] != arrT[t[i]]){
                return false;
            }
            // so we pair those blank characters.
            if(arrS[s[i]] == 0){
                arrS[s[i]] = count;
                arrT[t[i]] = count;
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```
