# 645. Set Mismatch

You have a set of integers `s`, which originally contains all the numbers from `1` to `n`. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in `s` got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in **repetition of one** number and **loss of another** number.

You are given an integer array `nums` representing the data status of this set after the error.

Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return them in the form of an array.

Example 1:

> Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
> 
> Output: [2,3]

Example 2:

> Input: nums = [1,1]
> 
> Output: [1,2]

Constraints:

* 2 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>

## Solution

### C++

1. nums[nums[i] - 1] will never access the index where the original number is replaced by the repeating number, so mark all the numbers accessed as negative when first encountered, store the number encountered second time as the repeating number.
2. abs(nums[i]) is required as there is a possibility that nums[i] is marked as negative provided its clone occupies the place before it, i.e., [2,2]
3. Traverse the vector again and store the index (index + 1 precisely) where the number is positive as the missing number.  
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findErrorNums(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> ret;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++){
            if(nums[abs(nums[i]) - 1] > 0){
                nums[abs(nums[i]) - 1] *= -1;
            }
            else {
                ret.push_back(abs(nums[i]));
            }
        }
        
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++){
            if(nums[i] > 0){
                ret.push_back(i + 1);
                break;
            }
        }
            
        return ret;    
    }
};
```
