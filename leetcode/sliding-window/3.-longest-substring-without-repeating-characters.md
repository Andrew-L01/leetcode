# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. 

Example 1:

> Input: s = "abcabcbb"
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Example 2:

> Input: s = "bbbbb"
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:

> Input: s = "pwwkew"
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
> 
> Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

Example 4:

> Input: s = ""
> 
> Output: 0 

Constraints:

* 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
* s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

## Solution

### C++

1. Expand the window and record the size of the window if the encountered character does not existed in the current window.
2. Shrink the window till the encountered character is distinct in current window. 
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        int i = 0, j = 0, result = 0;
        unordered_set<char> set;
        
        while(j < s.size()){
            // if current character is unique.
            if(set.find(s[j]) == set.end()){
                // then insert it (expand the window).
                set.insert(s[j]);
                j++;
                int length = set.size();
                // record the longest substring of non-repeating character.
                result = max(result, length);                
            }
            else {
                // shrink the window till the latest encountered character is distinct.
                set.erase(s[i]);
                i++;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```
