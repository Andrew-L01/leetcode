# 143. Reorder List

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L<sub>0</sub> → L<sub>1</sub> → … → L<sub>n - 1</sub> → L<sub>n</sub>

Reorder the list to be on the following form:

L<sub>0</sub> → L<sub>n</sub> → L<sub>1</sub> → L<sub>n - 1</sub> → L<sub>2</sub> → L<sub>n - 2</sub> → …

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed. 

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/04/reorder1linked-list.jpg)

> Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
> 
> Output: [1,4,2,3]

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/09/reorder2-linked-list.jpg)

> Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
> 
> Output: [1,5,2,4,3]

Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>].
* `1 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Solution

### C++

    /**
     * Definition for singly-linked list.
     * struct ListNode {
     *     int val;
     *     ListNode *next;
     *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
     *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
     *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
     * };
     */

1. Push all the nodes into a stack. 
2. Carry out operation(link the node as the next node) on the first floor(size/2) nodes.
3. Thus, the middle node will be left untouched(which is correct) for the case when size == odd, and we set the next node of the middle node as nullptr. 
4. However, half of the nodes will be operated in the case when size == even, which is incorrect since there should be no operation carried out between `last node of first half` and `first node of last half`(the middle node when size == odd acts as buffer) because it will use the `first node of last half` as the next node of the `last node of first half` and the curr pointer will land at the `first node of last half` at the end of while loop.
5. This will result in cyclic list (`first node of last half` points to itself), i.e., 1->4->2->3<->3
6. Luckily, `curr->next = nullptr` will still work since it is still pointing to itself :)
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    void reorderList(ListNode* head) {
        // Edge cases.
        if ((!head) || (!head->next) || (!head->next->next)) {
            return; 
        }        
        
        stack<ListNode*> stack;
        ListNode* curr = head;
        int size = 0;
        
        // Put all nodes in stack.
        while(curr) 
        {
            stack.push(curr);
            size++;
            curr = curr->next;
        }

        curr = head;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < size/2; i++){
            ListNode* node = stack.top();
            stack.pop();
            // insert the node between curr and curr->next. 
            node->next = curr->next;
            curr->next = node;
            curr = curr->next->next;
        }
        
        curr->next = nullptr;
    }
};
 ```
