# 594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence

We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is **exactly 1**.

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.

A **subsequence** of array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. 

Example 1:

> Input: nums = [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].

Example 2:

> Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
> 
> Output: 2

Example 3:

> Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
> 
> Output: 0

Constraints:

* 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
* -109 <= nums[i] <= 109

## Solution 

### C++

1. Sort the vector ascendingly. 
2. The ordering of if statements matter. 
```C++
class Solution {
public:
      int findLHS(vector<int>& nums) {
          sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
          int start = 0, temp = 0;
          int longestLen = 0;
          
          for(int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++){
              // if current nums[i] could not form a subsequence with nums[start]
              if(nums[i] - nums[start] > 1){
                // then assign start to the first index of last distinct number, i.e., [2(start), 2, 2, 3(temp), 3, 3, 5(i)]
                start = temp;    
              }                 
              // record the first index where the numbers change. 
              if(nums[i] != nums[i-1]) {
                temp = i;  
              }       
              // the ordering of 2nd and 3rd if-statement could be swapped but 3rd if-statement must appear after 1st if-statement.
              if(nums[i] - nums[start] == 1){
                longestLen = max(longestLen, i - start + 1);      
              }
          }
          
          return longestLen;
      }
};
```
